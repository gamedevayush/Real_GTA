This package contains the precomputed sky model and the standard sky model from a previous version (4.1.2) embedded in the same system.
While the new precomputed sky system does not arrive, you should use the version (v4.2.1). If you do not plan to use the precomputed sky model,
then you can delete the package from this folder to remove it from your project.

Note: Do not unpack this package here, since the naming of scripts and other assets is the same as the current system and this will throw a lot of errors. The best way to
use the precomputed sky model of this pack is to copy that package out of Unity and import it into another project separately.
